<div class="instructions">
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour the milk, water and oil into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir with a large spoon until just combined. A few lumps are okay; do not over mix or your pancakes won't be as fluffy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with vegan butter or coconut oil, and drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto it. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve with vegan butter, pure maple syrup and perhaps some fresh fruit.</li>
